## Motivation ::muscle:

- Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization's data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.
-  data science is a good career with tremendous opportunities for advancement in the future.
-  Companies and stakeholders can take data driven decisions and make useful insights to gain more profit and for further imporvement.
-  Data science field provides lots of job opportunities and  Harvard Business Review calls the role of a data scientist as "the sexiest job of the 21st century.
-  Doing data science task like big data handelling , preprocessing data , using machine learning model and using advanced topics like gradient boosting technique / algorithm , using cloud systems like IBM watson studio , Azure , Amazon web Service(AWS) , Google cloud platform (GCP) , etc to train and deploy model , it is quite brainstroming  and fun thing to do.
-  Data science project involves not only coding but other core skils like comunicating , storytelling , stakeholder management , we can learn lot from data science field.

## Introduction ::construction_worker:
- This is an collaborative project with IBM professional readiness
program for innovation, employability and entrepreneurship.
- Loan approval - Loan Approval means a statement by the lender setting forth the terms and conditions upon which the lender is willing to make a particular mortgage loan to a particular buyer
- This data science project will be implemented based on the applicant credit score , income ,etc.
- This project will be benfitted for stakeholders working in finance company , high level managers working in banks.
- This project main motive is to provide more insights and perform perfect data science task.

## Project tasks ::zap:
1. Get quality dataset - Data plays a major role in data science project
2. Perform Data handling with Pyspark if dataset is big.
3. Data cleaning - For acheiving accuracy , removing abnormalities , data outliers.
4. Explortory data analysis - In this step we provide stakeholders good insight by interactive visuals - Plotly.
5. preprocess before feeding to machine learning model.
6. Training machine learning model with scikit-learn and use Gradient Boosting algorithm / technique by - Xgboost , catboost ,LGBM , etc.
7. Using Cloud platform - IBM watson studio or azure ml.
8. Get feedback from mentors if any changes.
9. Deploy data science model.
